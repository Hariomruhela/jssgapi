"""Member and spouse photo slots.

The bytes live in object storage (Cloudflare R2 in production); Postgres only
holds the URL, the object key and the ``media`` row that tracks the object.
Each slot is written through everywhere a photo is already represented:

* ``members.profile_photo_url`` - the directory column the panel renders.
* ``members.<role>_photo_r2_url`` / ``members.<role>_photo_r2_object_key`` -
  the migration/repair bookkeeping columns the Drive migration uses.
* ``members.profile_data['member_photo_link' | 'spouse_photo_link']`` - the
  profile field ``GET /api/v1/profile`` returns.

Replacement uploads the new object first and only then overwrites the row, so
a storage failure can never leave a member pointing at an object that does not
exist. The previous object is deleted afterwards, best effort.
