"""Copy member photos from Google Drive into Cloudflare R2.

The member directory was seeded from a Google Sheet whose photo column holds
``drive.google.com`` share links. Those links cannot be rendered by the mobile
app: an unshared file resolves to an ``accounts.google.com`` sign-in page, and a
shared one resolves to Drive's HTML preview. ``Image.network`` gets neither.

This service fetches the bytes once and stores them under the same project
storage that serves uploads, then points the member's photo fields at a URL that
returns ``image/*`` with no cookies and no headers.

Design notes:

* **Nothing in Drive changes.** No file is shared, moved, renamed or deleted.
* **The original link is kept** in ``*_photo_drive_url`` so a photo stays
  re-syncable from the sheet, and so a changed sheet link is detected.
* **Idempotent.** A photo whose source has not changed is migrated at most once;
  re-running reports it as ``already_migrated`` and re-uploads nothing.
* **Changed links replace the photo.** When the sheet points at a different
  Drive file than the one last migrated, the new bytes are downloaded, the
  stored object is superseded, and the older object is deleted.
* **One failure never stops the run.** Every member is migrated in its own
  nested transaction, and an unreadable Drive file is recorded and skipped.
* **Reuses the existing storage backend** - there is no second R2 client, and
  no new upload path.
