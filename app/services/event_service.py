"""Event host details, timing and the cover image.

Two ideas live here:

* the **host** - who is running the event. It defaults to the account that
  created the event, so a host never has to type their own name and number
  again, but it stays editable for the times a different person is on the
  ground.
* the **cover image** - the event's profile picture. It is a single image
  stored on the event itself, separate from the gallery of up to ten images
  that ``EventImageService`` manages.
