"""An event's gallery: up to ten images.

The cover image is not part of this - it is the event's profile picture and
lives on the event itself (see ``EventService``). A gallery image is a link
between the event and the ``media`` row that tracks the stored object.

The limit is hard: an event holds at most ``MAX_IMAGES_PER_EVENT`` images.
It is checked twice - once against the size of the request and once against
what the event already holds - so neither a single oversized request nor a
series of requests can push an event past the limit.
